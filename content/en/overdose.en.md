On the floor the coffee was getting cold

While she was rereading those messages

That she would never send

Outside she heard the noise of traffic jams

One more buzz mark of the life

Life that was slowly leaving her

She sank into lethargy

In a letter said farewell

What's the point of continuing like this

That night she chose

For good it all came to an end

From an overdose she did not wake up.
