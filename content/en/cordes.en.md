title: 'Those cut strings, last breath'
---

Those strings that make me suffer

Until my last breath

Cuts obstacles to my smile

This race that suffocated me

How long must I endure this

I'll emerge exhausted

When will I escape

What more do I need to prove

What do I need to show

What do I need to prove

How do I need to sound

So those strings

Those strings I will cut

In a last breath.
