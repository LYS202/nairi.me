In this silence refuge I seek

In this silence my nightmares haunt me

In this silence of a note they twisted me

In this silence a mask they forced on me

In this silence this costume they nailed me to

In this silence with a foreign tongue they dress me

In this silence by a dead man's name they call me

In this silence upright I stand

In this silence upon this stool

In this silence rope in hand

So when I push this stool

Only resonates as a savior this silence.
