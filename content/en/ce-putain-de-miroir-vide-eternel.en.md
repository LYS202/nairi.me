title: 'This fuckin mirror, eternal hollow'
---

In this eternal hollow alone I am
In this eternal hollow alone I flee
In this eternal hollow alone I decay
In this eternal hollow alone I see
In this eternal hollow alone I drink
In this eternal hollow alone my nightmares I bury
In this eternal hollow for only law
In this eternal hollow reflects
The color of my defeats
The cloud of this storm
The nuance of this trumpet
And I observe at the top of this peak
I observe my doubts
I watch you leave down that road
While my madness
Led me to this road
Where breath costs me
And led to this black-out 
But for end of this story
Only make me suffer this fuckin' mirror.
